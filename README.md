## Description

**‚ö†Ô∏è For the time being, I'm building this collection of tools on my free time _AND_ according to what I'm learning at school. Therefore, the collection may be a little small at the moment ‚ö†Ô∏è**

This project provides a wide range of prebuilt jupyter-notebooks on different physic and chemistry related topics.

Each of the notebooks contains some useful python function like regression and titrations charts...
